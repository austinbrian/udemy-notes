# Backend Basics

The old system of development involved a **LAMP** stack:
* Linux
* Apache
* MySQL
* PHP

This was pretty basic and could only serve very simple requests.

Nowadays, backend is done through an application server:
* Node Server, using Node.js and Express.js
* Database of PostgreSQL / MongoDB

This allows you to check for logins in the backend database; Node.js allows you to not just run in a browser, but can be run live on a server as well.

# APIs
Application Programming Interface is a messenger that takes a request and tells another system what to do.

Some fun APIs:
- SWAPI: Star Wars API
- Twilio: Generate text messages
