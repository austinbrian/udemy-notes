# ES6 and JavaScript
ES6 stands for ECMAScript version 6. Version 5 and Version 6 introduced some new features to JavaScript that are widely used now.

## Babel
Babel is a Javascript compiler that enables next-generation Javascript. It reads the script line-by-line and then rewrites it into the older version. This means new features are supported using Babel.

## Let and const
We don't really ever need to use `var` ever again.

`let` allows the creation of variables inside an "if" scope.

`const` does not allow for a variable to be updated. If you have anything that's not going to change, it should be `const`.

For instance, if it's going to be a function, you can make it as a `const`.
If you're assigning a variable that might change (like a boolean val), use `let`

## Destructuring
Imagine you have some object with various attributes:
  `const user = { name: "Brian", experience: 40, advanced_degree: false }`
Using this deconstructing syntax, you can assign values out of the object keys.
So rather than doing this, which is repetitive:
  ```javascript
  const name = user.name;
  const experience = user.experience;
  let degree  = user.advanced_degree;
  ```
  you can do this:
  ```javascript
  const { name, experience } = user;
  let { advanced_degree } = user;
  ```
  and that is â€¦ better? I guess?

  Seems like it's useful for react.

## Template Strings
There work like format strings, but they use backticks. Make sure to use the curly braces for the variables within the string. Here is the syntax:
```javascript
  const name = "Sally";
  const age = 34;
  const pet = "fish";

  const greeting = `Hello ${name}, are you ${age-5}? That's a nice ${pet}.`
  ```
You can calculate things within the string.


## Default Argument
Work just like python default args.

## One last type
**Symbol** - (uses `let`) creates a unique function value

## Arrow functions
Change the function syntax to take away the curly braces where there is only one return.

So instead of:
```JavaScript
function exponentiation(a,b) {
    return a**b;
    }
```
you can do this all on one line, using `const`:
`const exp = (a,b) => a**b;`

But if you need more than one line, you can always use the curly braces like so:
```javascript
    const whereAmI = (username, location) => {
        if (username && location) {
            return "I am not lost";
        } else {
            return "I am totally lost!":
        }
    }
```

## Curried functions
This allows you to take a function with multiple arguments and turn it into something that takes in arguments one at a time.
The regular way to do an arrow function is like this:
`const multiply = (a,b) => a * b;`

But instead, a curried function takes this as multiple arguments:
`const curriedMultiply = (a) => (b) => a * b;`
If you try to call it with `curriedMultiply(3)` it will return the function: `(b) => 3 * b`
To call the whole function, use `curriedMultiply(3)(5);`.

This is nice since it makes any complex function extensible. You can get just a function that multiplies by 3 using `const curriedMultiply(3)` and then apply that elsewhere in the codebase.

# Compose
Syntax for calling functions of functions.
`const compose = (f, g) => a => f(g(a));``

This calls `g(a)`, and then runs the `f` function on the result. Just remember to stylize the composed function call using other functions.

`compose(aFunc, bFunc)(17);`
