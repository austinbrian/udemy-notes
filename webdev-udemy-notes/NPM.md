# NPM
NPM was created to allow developers to share JavaScript code. It enables developers to build on others' work.

## NPM Registry
Repository for packages. Search among them using a search bar. Found at [NPM JS](https://www.npmjs.com/) Each one contains:
- .js file
- package.json file

**Yarn** - an additional method for pulling packages from the NPM registry; generally speaking if you know NPM you know Yarn
